The advanced plugin allows you to optimize, clean and analyze your Wordpress database with few clicks.


== Description == 

[**WP DB Booster**](http://www.wpmaniax.com/wp-db-booster/) will help you to clean up, optimize and analyze your Wordpress database with few clicks.
You can clean up and optimize **more than 20 various** data types including orphan and duplicate metadata that can bloat your database.

If you edit your posts or pages Wordpress creates revision each time you save the post or page.

What does that mean?
Let's say your post is just 50KB in size. If you have 5 revisions for this post, they will occupy 250KB additional space in you DB.
And if you have 150 posts, it will be about **37MB of wasted space** and duplicate information in your Database.
And what if you have thousands of spam or unapproved comments in your DB?

**WP DB Booster** can clean up all of these unwanted, obsolete or junk records with just a single click.
